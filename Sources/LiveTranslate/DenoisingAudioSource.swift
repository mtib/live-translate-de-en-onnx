    // AGC, one stream often dominates the mix and the quieter one
    // gets buried (both in the per-source WAV and in the ASR input).
    //
    // We run a lightweight envelope-follower AGC per instance:
    //   - measure each buffer's RMS via `vDSP_measqv` (SIMD)
    //   - smooth a long-term EMA of RMS over voiced buffers only
    //   - compute a target gain that brings the EMA toward
    //     `agcTargetRMS`, capped between `agcMinGain` and `agcMaxGain`
    //   - smooth the *applied* gain itself (slow ramp) to avoid pumping
    //   - apply via `vDSP_vsmul` (SIMD multiply)
    //
    // The gain is only updated when the input has voiced signal
    // (rms > noise floor); silence preserves the previous gain so the
    // next utterance isn't blasted at max. Both apply paths
    // (recorder + transcriber) see the gained buffer because the
